    content: `
      <p>Buying your first home is exciting but can also be overwhelming. Here are the top 5 tips for first-time buyers in India:</p>

      <h3>1. Save for a Down Payment</h3>
      <p>Most banks require at least 10-20% of the property value as a down payment. Start saving early to reduce loan dependency.</p>

      <h3>2. Get Pre-Approved for a Home Loan</h3>
      <p>Knowing your loan eligibility helps in shortlisting properties within your budget. Check interest rates and processing fees from different banks.</p>

      <h3>3. Check RERA Registration</h3>
      <p>Verify if the builder and project are registered under <strong>RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority)</strong> to avoid fraud and delays.</p>

      <h3>4. Research the Location</h3>
      <p>Look for areas with good connectivity, upcoming infrastructure projects, and potential for property appreciation.</p>

      <h3>5. Be Prepared for Hidden Costs</h3>
      <p>Registration fees, maintenance charges, GST, and legal fees can add up. Budget for these additional costs.</p>

      <p>Buying a home is a big decision, and these tips will make your journey smoother!</p>

      <p>Choosing the right neighborhood is as important as choosing the home itself. Here's what to consider:</p>

      <h3>1. Connectivity & Transportation</h3>
      <p>Check how close the area is to metro stations, highways, and public transport hubs.</p>

      <h3>2. Future Development</h3>
      <p>Look for upcoming malls, IT parks, and schools. A developing area means higher property appreciation.</p>

      <p>Check crime rates, street lighting, and the presence of CCTV cameras in the locality.</p>

      <h3>4. Proximity to Work & Schools</h3>

      <h3>5. Local Amenities</h3>
